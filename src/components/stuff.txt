A README is included with the project. The README includes a description and clear instructions for installing and launching the project.

Whenever the user types something in the address bar, the user is asked to log in before the requested page is shown.

The option selected by the logged in user should be clearly marked. 

The application asks the user to sign in and shows a 404 page if that poll does not exist. (In other words, if a user creates a poll and then the same or another user tries to access that poll by its url, the user should be asked to sign in and then be shown a 404 page. Please keep in mind that new polls will not be accessible at their url because of the way the backend is set up in this application.)
